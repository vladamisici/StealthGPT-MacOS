# StealthGPT

Welcome to StealthGPT, your secret assistant that helps you generate responses using GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models directly from your clipboard. This app is perfect for anyone who frequently needs to generate content, answer questions, or get creative ideas without the hassle of switching between applications. Let's dive into how you can make the most out of StealthGPT!

## Use Case

Imagine you're working on an important project and need quick answers or content generation. Instead of hopping onto a web browser, logging into an AI service, and copying the response back, you can simply use StealthGPT. With a simple copy-paste action, StealthGPT will fetch responses from OpenAI's powerful language models and paste them back into your clipboard, ready to be used wherever you need them. It's like having a stealthy, intelligent assistant right at your fingertips!

## Features

- **Clipboard Monitoring**: StealthGPT watches your clipboard for new content and sends it to GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models for a response.
- **Stealth Mode**: Enable this mode to avoid notifications and keep your AI interactions discreet.
- **Easy Configuration**: Customize the language, field of expertise, and model used to tailor responses to your needs.

## Upcoming Features

### ULTRA-STEALTH MODE

We are excited to announce an upcoming feature perfect for those high-stakes moments, like taking exams. The ULTRA-STEALTH MODE will include:

- **Full App Concealment**: The app will hide any traces of its running processes.
- **Server Redirection**: If your university has banned ChatGPT's servers, this mode will redirect your requests to our server to ensure seamless access.
